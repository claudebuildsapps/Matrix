# Matrix Terminal GUI - Next Steps

## What's Been Accomplished

1. **Architecture Design**
   - Created a comprehensive architecture document (ARCHITECTURE_GUI.md)
   - Defined core components and their interactions
   - Outlined the technology stack using Rust, iced, alacritty_terminal, and portable-pty

2. **Simple GUI Prototype**
   - Implemented a functional Matrix-styled UI with iced framework
   - Created a sidebar with interactive buttons and hover effects
   - Implemented square borders and Matrix color scheme
   - Added a mock terminal interface with basic interactivity
   - Built keyboard input handling for terminal simulation

3. **Core Infrastructure**
   - Set up project structure for both simple prototype and full application
   - Created a flexible build system (build_gui.sh)
   - Implemented layout system design
   - Defined clear component interfaces

4. **Styling and UI**
   - Implemented the Matrix color palette (MATRIX_GREEN, DARK_GREEN)
   - Created custom button and container styles
   - Built a sidebar component with hover effects
   - Used square borders for all UI elements in keeping with the Matrix aesthetic

## Next Steps

### 1. Terminal Emulation (Priority: High)
- Integrate alacritty_terminal library into the GUI
- Implement proper terminal rendering with Matrix colors
- Add keyboard and mouse input handling for the terminal
- Connect terminal rendering to the process manager

### 2. Process Management (Priority: High)
- Finalize the PTY integration using portable-pty
- Implement process spawning, monitoring, and termination
- Handle terminal environment variables properly
- Add session persistence for opened terminals

### 3. Layout Management (Priority: Medium)
- Complete the implementation of the layout tree
- Add support for terminal splitting (horizontal and vertical)
- Implement window resizing and focus handling
- Add layout presets (grid, horizontal, vertical, main)
- Implement window zooming

### 4. UI Enhancements (Priority: Medium)
- Add smooth animations for terminal transitions
- Improve sidebar with tooltips showing key bindings
- Create a status bar with session information
- Add customization options for appearance

### 5. Session Management (Priority: Low)
- Implement saving and loading of workspace layouts
- Add support for named sessions
- Create a session switcher interface
- Implement auto-saving of session state

### 6. Packaging and Distribution (Priority: Low)
- Create proper app bundles for macOS
- Set up GitHub Actions for automatic builds
- Add installer scripts for easy deployment
- Create documentation for end users

## Implementation Order

1. First focus on completing the terminal emulation integration
2. Then implement the process management to get functioning terminals
3. Next, implement the layout management system
4. Add UI enhancements and polish
5. Finally, add session management and packaging

## Known Issues

1. The current sidebar implementation lacks tooltips
2. Terminal input handling is currently mocked
3. The build process needs refinement for cross-platform support
4. Layout implementation is in early stages
